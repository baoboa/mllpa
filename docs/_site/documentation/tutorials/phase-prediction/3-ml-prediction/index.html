<meta name="description" content="Once the models have been generated through ML-LPA, they can be used, either from the .lpm file or from the variable, to predict the phase of a simulation with an unknown composition. This tutorial shows how to proceed.  Predict phases  From an *.lpm file  To predict the lipid phases in a simulation, we need to first load the simulation files in an instance of the System class. Then, we can use the class method .getPhases() to run the prediction. This method only takes as an argument the path to the .lpm file.  import mllpa  # Load the unknown system unknown_system = mllpa.openSystem(&#39;unknown.gro&#39;, &#39;unknown.tpr&#39;, &#39;DPPC&#39;)  # Predict the phases unknown_system.getPhases(&quot;new_model.lpm&quot;)   In this example, we call a model file named new_model.lpm which have been generated in a previous step.  Since the models should be specific to the type of simulation run (e.g. temperature range, lipid mixture,   simulation parameters), we do not provide model files on this website and we recommend you to generate your own   model files.  ML-LPA will then process all the lipids in the system and assign each of them a phase based on their configurations. The results can be accessed through the .phases attribute of the instance of the System class:  lipid_phases = unknown_system.phases   This will output a NumPy string array with the dimension (# frames, # molecules).  From a variable  It is possible to use directly a model variable generated using the function generateModel(). To do so, just replace the argument in the .getPhases() method by the variable itself.  unknown_system.getPhases(models)   In this example, we call a model variable named models which have been generated in a previous step.  Machine Learning algorithms  In order to predict the lipid phases with the highest accuracy, ML-LPA relies on a 2-steps prediction system:          In the first step, the 2 types of data collected from the simulation files, atom coordinates and intra-molecular distances, are fed into 3 different ML algorithms defined in scikit-learn. The result is a total of 4 models looking at the data and making their independent predictions.           In the second step, the independent predictions collected in the first step are analysed by a classification tree algorithm, also defined in scikit-learn, that compares the predictions to output the most accurate prediction possible.      First predictions  The four models used to analyse the input data are:          Support Vector Machine, trained on coordinates.           Support Vector Machine again, trained this time on distances.           K-Nearest Neighbors, trained on coordinates.           Gaussian Naive Bayes, trained on distances.      The scores of each of the model, total and per phase, are all stored in the .lpm model files.  Second and final prediction  The predictions of the 4 models above are classified using the Classification and Regression Trees algorithm. The scores of this model, total and per phase, is also stored in the .lpm model files. However, the CART model defined by scikit-learn can also output the classification tree determined through the training. This can be done using the typical following command.  In this example, we will need to import the Matplotlib library to plot the data.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 import mllpa import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from sklearn import tree  # Load the simulations files to be trained on gel_system = mllpa.openSystem(&#39;gel.gro&#39;, &#39;gel.tpr&#39;, &#39;DPPC&#39;) fluid_system = mllpa.openSystem(&#39;fluid.gro&#39;, &#39;fluid.tpr&#39;, &#39;DPPC&#39;)  # Train the model on the systems - do not save the model files models = mllpa.generateModel([gel_system, fluid_system], phases=[&#39;gel&#39;, &#39;fluid&#39;], save_model=False)  # Extract the CART model from the dictionary cart_model = models[&#39;ClassificationTree&#39;]  # Display the classification tree tree.plot_tree(cart_model) plt.show()   The classification tree should be directly displayed when the script is run.

        <p>Once the models have been generated through ML-LPA, they can be used, either from the <strong>.lpm file</strong>
or from the <strong>variable</strong>, to predict the phase of a simulation with an unknown composition. This tutorial
shows how to proceed.</p>

<h2 id="predict-phases">Predict phases</h2>

<h3 id="from-an-lpm-file">From an *.lpm file</h3>

<p>To predict the lipid phases in a simulation, we need to first load the simulation files in an instance of the System class.
Then, we can use the class method <em>.getPhases()</em> to run the prediction. This method only takes as an argument the
<strong>path to the .lpm file</strong>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">mllpa</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p class="notice--info">In this example, we call a model file named <em>new_model.lpm</em> which have been generated
in a <a href="/mllpa/documentation/tutorials/phase-prediction/1-training/#generate-the-model-files">previous step</a>.</p>

<p class="notice--warning">Since the models should be specific to the type of simulation run (<em>e.g.</em> temperature range, lipid mixture,
  simulation parameters), <strong>we do not provide model files</strong> on this website and we recommend you to generate your own
  model files.</p>

<p>ML-LPA will then process all the lipids in the system <strong>and assign each of them a phase</strong>
based on their configurations. The results can be accessed through the <em>.phases</em> attribute of
the instance of the System class:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">lipid_phases</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">unknown_system</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">phases</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will output a NumPy string array with the dimension <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(# frames, # molecules)</code>.</p>

<h3 id="from-a-variable">From a variable</h3>

<p>It is possible to use directly a <strong>model variable</strong> generated using the function <em>generateModel()</em>.
To do so, just replace the argument in the <em>.getPhases()</em> method by the variable itself.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">unknown_system</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">getPhases</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p class="notice--info">In this example, we call a model variable named <em>models</em> which have been generated
in a <a href="/mllpa/documentation/tutorials/phase-prediction/1-training/#extract-directly-the-models-in-variables">previous step</a>.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-algorithms">Machine Learning algorithms</h2>

<p>In order to predict the lipid phases with the highest accuracy, ML-LPA relies on a
2-steps prediction system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In the first step, the 2 types of data collected from the simulation files, <em>atom coordinates</em>
and <em>intra-molecular distances</em>, are fed into 3 different ML algorithms defined in <strong>scikit-learn</strong>.
The result is a total of 4 models looking at the data and making their independent predictions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second step, the <em>independent predictions</em> collected in the first step are analysed
by a <strong>classification tree algorithm</strong>, also defined in scikit-learn, that compares the predictions
to output the most accurate prediction possible.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="first-predictions">First predictions</h3>

<p>The four models used to analyse the input data are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#support-vector-machines">Support Vector Machine</a>, trained on coordinates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support Vector Machine again, trained this time on distances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#nearest-neighbors-classification">K-Nearest Neighbors</a>, trained on coordinates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html#gaussian-naive-bayes">Gaussian Naive Bayes</a>, trained on distances.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The scores of each of the model, total and per phase, are all stored in the .lpm model files.</p>

<h3 id="second-and-final-prediction">Second and final prediction</h3>

<p>The predictions of the 4 models above are classified using the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#classification">Classification and Regression Trees</a> algorithm.
The scores of this model, total and per phase, is also stored in the .lpm model files.
However, the CART model defined by scikit-learn can also <strong>output the classification tree determined through the training</strong>. This can be done using
the typical following command.</p>

<p>In this example, we will need to import the Matplotlib library to plot the data.</p>
