<p>Depending on the situation, some <em>lipids</em> - or other <em>membrane molecules</em> - might not undergo a phase
transition during the simulations. For instance, the <em>dioleoyl-glycerophosphocholine</em> (DOPC) has a transition
temperature of -17C, so it more than likely that it will remain in the fluid phase for all simulations run
in the water (&gt; 0C). The problem of these molecules is that ML-LPA <strong>cannot be trained</strong> to predict their phases, and because of that
<a href="/mllpa/documentation/#d---local-environment-analysis">analysis of the local environment</a> cannot be processed.</p>

<p>To avoid these problem, <strong>phases can be assigned manually</strong> in ML-LPA to an instance of the System class.</p>

<h2 id="manual-phase-assignment">Manual phase assignment</h2>

<h3 id="single-assignment">Single assignment</h3>

<p>To assign the lipid phases in a simulation, we need to first load the simulation files in an instance of the System class.
Then, we can use the class method <em>.setStates()</em> to assign the phases. This method only takes as an argument the string with
the name of the phase.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">mllpa</span>

<span class="c1"># Load the unknown system
</span><span class="n">unknown_system</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mllpa</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">openSystem</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'unknown.gro'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'unknown.tpr'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'DOPC'</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>ML-LPA will then process all the lipids in the system and assign to each of them <strong>the given phase</strong>.
The final result can be accessed through the <em>.states</em> attribute of the instance of the System class
<a href="/mllpa/documentation/tutorials/phase-prediction/4-ml-prediction/#from-an-lpm-file">as shown previously</a>.</p>

<h3 id="molecule-by-molecule-assignment">Molecule-by-molecule assignment</h3>

<p>The method <em>.setStates()</em> can also be used to <strong>assign a whole NumPy string array</strong> to the molecules
stored in the instance.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">unknown_system</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">setStates</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lipid_phases</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p class="notice--info">In this example, we call a NumPy array named <em>lipid_phases</em> which have been generated
outside of the example script.</p>

<p>The NumPy string array used as input shoudl have the dimension <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(# frames, # molecules)</code>.</p>

    <p>Now you know how the phases of your unknown systems can been assigned, you can
start to analyse the <a href="">local environment of the lipids</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can also <a href="">store the results</a> in a file.</p>
