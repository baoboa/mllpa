<p>Similarly, to the attributes, the <strong>methods of an instance of the System class</strong> does not bear too much interest
in a standard quick and dirty use of ML-LPA. We describe in this tutorial some of the most useful methods of the class.</p>

<p class="notice--info">If you are only interested in getting ML-LPA to work quickly, we recommend to directly
move to the tutorials on <a href="">phase prediction</a>.</p>

<h2 id="re-generate-the-coordinates-and-distances">Re-generate the coordinates and distances</h2>

<p>The <strong>coordinates</strong> and <strong>distances</strong> contained in the instance of the class were computed when the
instance was first created. As a result, an update of the <strong>positions</strong> held in the instance will not be
automatically reflected on the coordinates and distances. To compute the arrays again, two methods
can be called.</p>

<h3 id="atom-coordinates">Atom coordinates</h3>

<p>To re-generate the coordinates of the atom in the <strong>cylindrical system of coordinates</strong>, the
method <em>.getCoordinates()</em> can be used.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">mllpa</span>

<span class="c1"># We first load a system for our exemple
</span><span class="n">loaded_system</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mllpa</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">openSystem</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'test.gro'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'test.tpr'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'DPPC'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># We replace the positions array in the instance of the class with one generated previously
</span><span class="n">loaded_system</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">positions</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">new_position_array</span>

<span class="c1"># We finally regenerate the coordinates to the new positions
</span><span class="n">loaded_system</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">getCoordinates</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p class="notice--info">In this example, we use the <em>openSystem()</em> function to load the information from
the simulation files. Check the <a href="/mllpa/documentation/tutorials/loading-files/1-simulation-files/">related tutorial</a> for more details.</p>

<p class="notice--warning">Please be aware that we have not defined the array <em>new_position_array</em> in the example above.
The dimensions of the new array should be exactly the same as the ones of the previous one.</p>

<h3 id="intra-molecular-atomic-distances">Intra-molecular atomic distances</h3>

<p>To re-generate the <strong>intra-molecular distances</strong> from the new position array, the
method <em>.getDistances()</em> can be used.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">loaded_system</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">getDistances</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rank</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This method can also be used to simply update the neighbour rank used in the computation without
reloading the whole instance from the simulation files. A detailed example is shown in the <a href="">dedicated tutorial</a>.</p>

<p class="notice--warning">The value of the neihbor rank should be optimised by the user, based on the systems
being used to train the Machine Learning algorithms. The rank equals to 6 here is
an example.</p>

  machine learning analysis, or use an existing model to predict the <a href="">phases in the system</a>.</li>
