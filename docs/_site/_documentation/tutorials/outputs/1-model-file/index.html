<p>ML-LPA uses its own file type to store the trained Machine Learning models:
the <strong>.lpm</strong> files (<ins>L</ins>ipid <ins>P</ins>hase <ins>M</ins>odel).
This tutorial explore thoroughly these files.</p>

<h2 id="the-lpm-file-format">The .lpm file format</h2>

<p>The <strong>.lpm</strong> are neither text nor binary files: they are in fact <strong>.zip compressed files</strong>
with a custom extension. Inside the archive can be found several text files defining the Machine Learning
models and describing the training scores.</p>

<p>There are multiple reasons to explain the choice of this unusual format:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Using a non-binary file format <strong>prevents compatibility issues</strong> (<em>e.g.</em> different pickles version).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compressing the several files in a <strong>single archive file</strong> avoids losing some of the file
by mistake and prevents modifications of the text files by mistake.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using a <strong>different file extension</strong> prevents confusion with other archive files.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="opening-the-lpm-file">Opening the .lpm file</h3>

<p>The .lpm files can be easily opened and explored. You will first need to <strong>modify the file extension</strong> and
then <strong>open the archive file</strong>. This can be done <strong>manually in the GUI</strong> of your operating system, or within the
Terminal with the <strong>following commands</strong> (in which can renaming in not required).</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">mkdir </span>model_contents
<span class="o">&gt;</span> unzip model_test.lpm <span class="nt">-d</span> model_contents
</code></pre></div></div>

<p class="notice--info">In this example, the .lpm file <em>model_test.lpm</em> have been created using the function
<em>generateModel()</em>. Check the <a href="/mllpa/documentation/tutorials/phase-prediction/1-training/#generate-the-model-files">related tutorial</a> for more details.</p>

<h3 id="the-training-csv-files">The training .csv files</h3>

<p>The <strong>.lpm archive</strong> contains three data files in the .csv format:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>model_coordinates.csv</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>model_distances.csv</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>model_states.csv</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid any compatibility issue with different scikit-learn versions,
<strong>the instance of the scikit-learn model classes are never directly saved</strong> in the files.
Instead, the training datasets are stored in the file and are used later to re-train the models
on them.</p>

<h3 id="the-metadata-xml-file">The metadata .xml file</h3>

<p>The <strong>.lpm archive</strong> also contains one data files in the .xml format: the <strong>model_data.xml metadata file</strong>.
In this files are stored several types of information collected during the training:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>information on the systems</strong> that have been used to train the models (<em>e.g.</em> name of the molecule type,
number of molecules).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>settings</strong> used for the training (<em>e.g.</em> neighbour rank, size of the training subsets).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>scores obtained during the training</strong>, either the final scores for each phases or the scores for each models used in ML-LPA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other general metadata (<em>e.g.</em> ML-LPA and scikit-learn versions, date and time)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>Now that you know how what is inside a .lpm file, you can use it to <a href="">predict the phases</a> in an unknown system.</li>
</ul>
