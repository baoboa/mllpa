<p>Besides the phase prediction, the other key feature of ML-LPA is its capacity to
<strong>analyse the local environment</strong> of membrane molecules. This is done by performing
<strong>Voronoi tessellations</strong> in order to list the direct neihbors of each molecule.</p>

<h2 id="defining-the-geometry">Defining the geometry</h2>

<h3 id="ghost-lipids">Ghost lipids</h3>

<p>Doing a <strong>2-Dimension Voronoi tessellations</strong> of a <strong>lipid bilayer</strong> is straightforward. The two
leaflets are studied separately, and for each leaflet all the centers of mass are inside the same Z plane,
plus or minus non-significant fluctuations. In this approach, and in this approach only, ML-LPA
can proceed straight to the tessellation. However, <strong>3-Dimension tessellations</strong> but also alternative membrane geometries,
such as <strong>lipid vesicles</strong>, cannot be processed with the same ease.</p>

<p>In any other type of 3-D Voronoi tessellation, the space is filled with approximatively the same molecular distribution
<strong>along each axis</strong>. When considering a lipid bilayer, the distributions in X and Y, <em>i.e.</em> in the plane of the bilayer
filled with lipid molecules, are different from the distribution in Z, filled mostly with solvent and/or solute.
If one want to map the <strong>lipid neighbors or each lipid</strong>, done by discarding all non-lipid molecules from the
tessellations, the <strong>periodic boundary conditions (PBC) in Z</strong> will lead to lipid finding neighbors in the other
leaflet by looking through the PBC and not through the membrane. This situation is even <strong>worse in the case of a vesicle</strong>
were lipids are everywhere but always separated by blocks of solvent (invisible during the tessellation).
As a result, the neighbor mapping will be <strong>significantly biased</strong> or even completely wrong.</p>

<center><sub>(Left) Issue with the tessellation in vesicles, where lipids will detect neighbors through the solvent block. (Right) Use of ghost lipids to prevent this effect.</sub></center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>To prevent this, ML-LPA will generate and assign to each lipid a <strong>ghost</strong>. A ghost is a <em>fake</em> lipid
that is created by mirroring the <em>real</em> lipid position at the solvent-bilayer interface.
Because of their proximity to the lipid they mirror at the interface, <strong>the ghost will always be picked</strong> when the tessellation
will be searching for the neighbors before the lipid could search through the PBC. Since the ID of the ghost lipids in the tessellation
are known by ML-LPA, they are finally removed from the lists of neighbors, living the real lipids with a list on only lipids
they detected close to them without going through the solvent.</p>

<h3 id="the-membrane-geometry">The membrane geometry</h3>

<p>To create the ghosts, ML-LPA will first locate the <strong>center of mass of all the lipids of the membrane</strong>.
Then, it will compute <strong>all the vectors</strong> between the centers of mass of the individual lipids and
the center of mass of the membrane, as well as the <strong>distances</strong> between the center of mass of each lipid and
the position of its furthest atom from the center of mass of the membrane. The ghost is then created
by using the <strong>vectors and adding to their norm twice the distances</strong>. While this process is quite general,
it is extremely dependent of the <strong>membrane geometry</strong>. For instance, the center of mass of a vesicle is easy to define,
but a punctual center of mass for a bilayer is meaningless because of the PBC. Instead, for a bilayer, the whole XY plane
going through the average Z position of the lipid is used as a center of mass, making all the vectors parallel to
the normal to the membrane.</p>

<p>In order to run the tessellation, the user has to specify the geometry. The current version of ML-LPA can work with the following inputs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lipid bilayers, either with leaflet separation (<em>bilayer</em>) or not (<em>bilayer_3d</em>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lipid vesicles, either with leaflet separation (<em>vesicle</em>) or not (<em>vesicle_3d</em>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whole solution without ghost generation (<em>solution</em>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="notice--info">We are currently working on a new version of ML-LPA to automatically detect the
geometry of the membrane. This page will be updated once the detection has been implemented.</p>

<h2 id="run-the-analysis">Run the analysis</h2>

<p>The <strong>ghost generation</strong> and the <strong>Voronoi tessellation</strong> are both performed by the same
function in ML-LPA, <em>doVoro()</em>. Similarly to the function <em>generateModel()</em>, <em>doVoro()</em> takes
as an input a list of instances of the System class. However, if only one instance is
given, <em>doVoro()</em> will automatically read it as a list of Systems. As explained above, we also need to
specify the geometry of the membrane.</p>

<p>In this example, we only wanted to analyse one instance of the System class, <em>unknown_system</em>.
All the relevant information on the systems and their tessellations have been stored in the variable <em>tessellation</em> as
an instance of the <strong>Tessellation</strong> class. More information on the Tessellation class are given in the
<a href="/mllpa/documentation/api/classes/tessellation/">API</a>.</p>

<p class="notice--warning">Since <em>doVoro()</em> needs to calculate the center of mass of the whole membrane, it is
essential to include all the systems containing all the molecules making the membrane.</p>

<p>In some cases, it can be important to exclude some molecules from the ghost generation.
For instance, molecules completely inserted in the hydrophobic tails of the lipids (<em>e.g.</em> cholesterol)
do not need ghosts, and <strong>having ghosts might create issues</strong> when the Voronoi cells of the individual lipids
will be generated. To prevent this, we can exclude some systems from the ghost generation using the <em>exclude_ghost=</em>
keyword-argument. It takes as an input a list of indices corresponding to the systems to exclude in their
respective input list.</p>

<h3 id="spurious-neighbors">Spurious neighbors</h3>

<p>The main use of the Voronoi tessellation in ML-LPA is to find the <strong>closest neighbors</strong> of each lipid.
However, due to the complexity of a 3-d tessellation, <strong>geometrical aberrations</strong> can occur. As a result,
two molecules that are not closest neighbors will be identified as such because the tessellation was able to
find even a micro-surface that could connect both.</p>

<p>To remove such spurious neighbors from the list of neighbors, ML-LPA apply a <strong>threshold at a given ratio of the total surface of the Voronoi cell</strong>.
Each facet connecting two molecules being below this ratio will be removed from the list. By default, the threshold value is set to 1% of the total
surface of the cell. It can be changed with the keyword-argument <em>threshold=</em>.</p>

<h3 id="area-and-volume-per-lipid">Area and volume per lipid</h3>

<p>Performing the Voronoi tessellation automatically computes the <strong>volume of each of the Voronoi cell</strong>. For a lipid bilayer
tiled in 2-D, this corresponds to the <strong>area per lipid</strong>. For a bilayer tiled in 3-D, this is the <strong>volume per lipid</strong>.</p>

<p>This values can be accessed in the <strong>instance of the Tessellation class</strong> generated by <em>doVoro()</em>, by using the <em>.volumes</em> attribute.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">lipid_area</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tessellation</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">volumes</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p class="notice--info">Both lipid areas and lipid volumes are called from the <em>.volumes</em> attribute. The nature
of the value extracted depends on the geometry selected in the <em>doVoro()</em> keyword-argument.</p>
